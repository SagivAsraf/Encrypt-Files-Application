# Encrypt-Files-Application
An application for encrypt "secrets" txt files data

Hello everyone.
I think its a common that people saved their "secrets" file on their computer.
The file maybe include passwords for your bank account, 
or maybe it include a deep secret you wrote in it, and you dont want anyone to see it?
I have the perfect solution for you!
an simple application, that takes all the information from your file and encrypt it by encryption key that you choose!

I add 2 pictures to conceptualize and explain how to use this app.

(of course its not officially app, and if you really want to use that you will have to run it on development software).

enjoy :)
